# Group 22 Turtlebot3 Maze navigation with Multi Team

It ulitizes Gazebo and ROS1 Melodic SLAM and Navigation to explore unknown maze and calculate how to reach set goals in the most efficent way possible without hitting obstacles.

# What is Learned
* Code the maze into the Gazebo simulation
* Create an algorithm
* Python file for the follower's function to adjust the distance and speed
  
# Known Issue
* Will only follow a few times before going on its own
